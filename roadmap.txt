Features needed
===============

- Exception list for directories. In some systems users have created
  directories, which have thousands of subdirectories. These are made by custom
  scripts and not open-source software where we are interested to get the
  version number. Exceptions could be listed as -e "directory/directory2"
- Checksum feature. This is needed when grepped version number does not tell the
  real version number e.g. when security patch did not bump the version. Example
  case: http://www.exponentcms.org/
- Implement configuration file to include database, logging and CSV file names
  (idea partly from ryanph)
- Test cases for YAML structure using real files from major projects like
  WordPress and Drupal (idea partly from NFM-8)
