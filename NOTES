Here is the fingerprint guidelines. Please note that some of these lines contain
my personal opinion of the organization. If you don't share the opinion we can
discuss about the subject, but I won't probably erase the line.

1) Always check data before commiting to master. Please note that current
TODO-list is pretty much made in hurry. It was originally made for private use.

2) Don't link to securityfocus. They don't always include researchers name nor
references in advisories they copied from others. It's pretty much "we found
this issue", which in most cases is not true.

3) Use full URL to OSVDB in format <http://osvdb.org/id>.

4) HTBridge advisories MUST have CVE or OSVDB link. Please manually reproduce
all of their advisories before implementing. Double checking does not hurt.
Accurate information is key in here.

5) You should not make fingerprints for commercial products in case the product
is not well known and widely used.

6) Don't link to cxsecurity.com even their advisories are usually good, but
those are not verified information nor do they update the advisories even
original resources are updated or even when they are contacted. These links are
fine in the TODO items for fingerprints.

Contact maintainer of the project in case of questions.
